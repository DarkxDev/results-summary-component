## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library

Due to time constrains, this version of the project doesn't include a mobile version.

### What I learned

I used this project mainly to exercise my React skills since I'm new to it and still learning.
